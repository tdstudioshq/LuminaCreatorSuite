## 1. Migration Baseline (🔴 — the prerequisite debt)

**🟡 Validated from-zero (Docker + CI) — only remote byte-exact reconciliation remains.** A squashed, rebuildable-from-zero baseline (`supabase/migrations/20260511000000_baseline.sql`) reconstructs the full schema — base tables, RLS, storage buckets, the signup trigger, and all functions — and the four incomplete incrementals are archived under `supabase/_archive/pre_baseline_migrations/`. The signup trigger and base RLS are now **in the repo** and auditable.

Verified June 25, 2026: `bun run db:validate` rebuilt from zero on a real Docker daemon and the smoke assertions passed; **GitHub Actions** run `28170007528` repeats the from-zero rebuild + smoke on a clean runner (green).

Remaining (the reason this is 🟡 not ✅):
- The baseline was **reconstructed**, not dumped from the live DB. Diff against a real `supabase db dump` before treating it as byte-exact. **Auth-blocked so far** — no Supabase access token / DB password in the dev env.
- Reconcile remote migration history: `supabase migration repair --status applied 20260511000000` (mutates remote — run deliberately).
- Confirm Postgres `major_version` (config.toml = 15) against the remote.

## 2. Repository / Process Debt

| Item | Sev | Notes | Phase |
|------|-----|-------|-------|
| **No Git metadata** in workspace | 🟠 | No history/diff/provenance; `bun run format` once rewrote ~1,069 files, so "recently modified" ≠ "behaviorally changed" | P1 |
| **No test runner** | 🟠 | Vitest/Jest not configured though spec requires money/entitlement/RLS tests | P1 |
| ~~No CI~~ | ✅ | Done in P2A — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint/typecheck/test/build + a Docker `db-validate` job | P2A |
| Stale `/docs/data-model` | 🟡 | Describes tables/fields that don't match generated types | P1 |
| Lovable-generated files marked "do not edit" | 🟡 | `client.ts`, `client.server.ts`, `auth-middleware.ts`, `types.ts` are generated; coordinate regeneration | ongoing |

## 3. Current Shortcuts (behavioral)

| Shortcut | Sev | Where | Phase |
|----------|-----|-------|-------|
| Auth/route protection is **client-side only** | 🔴 | `dashboard.tsx`, `admin.tsx` — no server loaders | P2/P7 |
| Every signup becomes a **creator**; no member role | 🔴 | `cabana-auth.ts` + trigger | P2 |
| `?redirect=` consumed directly (open-redirect risk) | 🟠 | `dashboard.tsx` | P2 |
| Follow state is local `useState`, resets on refresh | 🟠 | `$username.tsx` | P2 |
| Saved `theme` stored but **not applied** to public page | 🟡 | `$username.tsx` / `cabana-store.ts` mapping | P1 |
| Sidebar shows hardcoded "Pro" plan regardless of `profile.plan` | 🟡 | `Sidebar.tsx` | P1 |
| Onboarding data mostly not persisted; theme IDs mismatch `CabanaTheme` | 🟡 | `onboarding.tsx` | P1 |
| Onboarding reachable before auth → dashboard redirects to login | 🟡 | `onboarding.tsx` | P1 |
| Non-atomic link reorder (N independent updates) | 🟡 | `useCabanaMutations.setLinks` | P1 |
| Mutations write on **every input change**; no debounce | 🟡 | `ProfileEditor`, inline editors | P1 |
| No delete confirmation / URL validation | 🟡 | `LinkManager`, `StoreManager` | P1 |
| Dead buttons & `#` links (CTAs, footer, message/product, pricing, AI, media-kit, settings, admin) | 🟡 | marketing + dashboard demos | P1 |
| `$username` shadows unknown top-level slugs (wrong 404) | 🟡 | route precedence | P5(routes)/P1 |

## 4. Demo Implementations (must be replaced, not extended)

| Surface | Demo nature | Replace in |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `cabana-demo-data.ts` (`CABANA_DEMO_DATA`) | Deterministic generators; `mock_` provider refs; fixed clock 2026-06-25 | P2–P6 (per domain) |
| 9 `FoundationPage` routes | Coming-soon placeholders | P1 (demo UI) → P2–P9 (real) |
| AI Studio / AI marketing | Simulated generation, hardcoded samples, timers | Long-term |
| Media kit | Hardcoded Aurora metrics; export buttons dead | Long-term |
| Settings integrations | Hardcoded Stripe/Mailchimp/Shopify/Calendly/social; actions dead | Long-term |
| Admin (8 panels) | Hardcoded arrays; every action non-functional | P7–P8 |
| `/td`, `/eldondolla` | Bespoke static profiles bypassing the data model | optional (microsites) |
| Pricing | 4 plans, no checkout; landing teaser shows 3 (inconsistent) | P3/P6 |
| Mock money | Integer-cents demo transactions/balances | keep demo until P6 real |

**Demo discipline:** demo monetary state can be mistaken for real if labeling is inconsistent — every mock surface needs a visible "Demo" label and `mock_` references; succeeded mock transactions are immutable like real ones.

## 5. Data-Model Debt

| Item | Sev | Phase |
|------|-----|-------|
| `subscriptions` name = CABANA SaaS plan, collides with future fan subs | 🔴 | rename → `platform_subscriptions` in P3 |
| `creator_profiles.user_id` **nullable** (ownerless seeds) | 🟠 | constrain real accounts in P2 |
| Product `price` stored as **display string** (no math/checkout) | 🟠 | → `price_cents` + currency, P5 |
| Link `scheduled` stored as **text label**, not timestamp; no true scheduled publish | 🟡 | P1/P2 |
| No publish/visibility model on links/products | 🟡 | P2 |
| Public profile fields not separated from owner-only fields | 🟠 | public-safe views, P2 |
| No `member_profiles` / settings / entitlements / ledger tables | 🔴 | P2–P6 |
| Money stored without explicit currency in legacy tables | 🟠 | P5 |

## 6. Security Improvements

| Item | Sev | Detail | Phase |
|------|-----|--------|-------|
| Public creator read uses `select("*")` → **leaks `user_id`** | 🔴 | Replace with public-safe view omitting owner id | P2 |
| Public storage URLs (`getPublicUrl`) unsuitable for paid/private media | 🔴 | Private buckets + short-lived signed URLs gated by entitlement | P2/P4/P5 |
| Admin protection client-side; real admin data/actions ungated | 🔴 | Server-validated capability claims | P7 |
| Service-role client exists but discipline depends on import hygiene | 🟠 | Keep `client.server.ts` server-only; lint guard | ongoing |
| Anonymous analytics inserts spammable (RLS only checks profile exists) | 🟠 | Rate-limit + tighten insert policy | P2/P10 |
| Upload validation mostly client-side; extensions trusted | 🟠 | Server-side MIME-signature/size/dimension checks; EXIF strip | P2/P5 |
| No CSP observed (HSTS/referrer/nosniff present) | 🟠 | Add Content-Security-Policy + headers | P10 |
| No MFA (admins), CAPTCHA, OAuth, email-verify branch | 🟠 | Auth hardening | P7/P10 |
| `?redirect=` not allow-listed | 🟠 | Safe-redirect allow-list | P2 |
| No webhook signature verification / idempotency yet | 🔴 (when money lands) | `webhook_events` + signatures | P6 |
| Provider tokens / verification fields unencrypted (none yet) | 🟠 | Encrypt at rest when introduced | P6/P10 |

## 7. Performance Improvements

| Item | Sev | Detail | Phase |
|------|-----|--------|-------|
| Missing FK/RLS indexes on future tables | 🟠 | Index every FK + RLS-filter column; composite (creator_id, published_at, id) etc. | P2+ |
| No cursor pagination (feeds/messages/notifications) | 🟠 | `(created_at, id)` cursors, not deep offsets | P2/P4/P9 |
| No partial indexes for unread/pending/active/undeleted | 🟡 | unread notifications, pending payouts, open reports | P2/P6/P8/P9 |
| Build warns: shared chunks > 500 kB | 🟡 | Code-split heavy routes; lazy-load admin/marketing | P1/P10 |
| `QueryClient` per router instance; no global stale/retry policy | 🟡 | Tune defaults; consider hydration policy | P1 |
| Mutations lack optimistic updates / transactional rollback | 🟡 | Add where UX benefits | P1/P3 |
| No web-font import found (relies on local fonts) | 🟡 | Verify/host Space Grotesk + Inter | P1/P10 |
| `pg_stat_statements` not enabled/monitored | 🟡 | Enable + monitor | P2/P10 |
| Don't hold DB locks across external API calls (future money) | 🔴 | Keep payment txns short; external calls outside DB txn | P6 |

## 8. Refactoring Opportunities

| Opportunity | Sev | Detail | Phase |
|-------------|-----|--------|-------|
| No typed `Button`; utility classes only | 🟡 | Introduce typed CABANA button (keep `.btn-luxury`/`.btn-ghost` look) | P1 |
| Each screen hand-rolls modals/drawers; Radix primitives unused | 🟡 | Shared `Modal`/`Dialog`/`Sheet` wrappers from `components/ui` | P1/P4 |
| No shared form abstraction beyond `AuthField`; RHF+Zod installed, unused | 🟡 | Adopt RHF+Zod + shared schemas (client+server) | P1/P2 |
| `/td`, `/eldondolla`, `$username` duplicate profile concepts | 🟡 | Shared profile renderer with variants/templates | optional |
| `cabana-store.ts` uses `any` casts on Supabase updates | 🟡 | Tighten with generated `TablesUpdate<>` types | P2 |
| Components organized by page, not business boundary | 🟡 | Move to `components/cabana/{posts,members,messaging,...}` | P1–P2 |
| Server-action plumbing exists but unused (`auth-middleware`, `client.server`, `auth-attacher` unregistered) | 🟠 | Wire up T2 tier; register `auth-attacher` in `start.ts` | P2 |
| No shared `EmptyState`/`LoadingState`/`ErrorState`/`Money` | 🟡 | Extract; mutations need consistent loading/error/empty UX | P1 |
| Marketing content is module-level constants in components | 🟡 | Acceptable for now; revisit if CMS-driven | Long-term |

## 9. Testing Debt (🟠)

None today. Needed: unit (mappers, validation, **money**, **entitlements**) · RLS policy tests per role (guest/member/creator/moderator/admin) · integration (auth, profile CRUD, uploads, analytics) · E2E (signup → publish) · payment/webhook/idempotency · accessibility + responsive visual regression · load (feeds/messages/notifications/analytics). Stand up the runner in **P1**; expand each phase.

## 10. Deployment & Ops Debt (🟠)

Git history · documented staging/prod envs · CI gates · preview-deploy policy · secrets rotation/ownership · DB backups + PITR + DR runbook · monitoring/error-tracking/uptime/alerting · payment reconciliation + RLS-failure + webhook-failure + queue-lag alerts. Begin in **P2**, complete in **P10**.

## Top 7 to Burn Down First (impact × risk)
1. 🔴 Validated **baseline migration** (P2) — unblocks all backend work.
2. 🔴 **Member role** + server-side auth/route gating (P2) — unblocks the whole member product and closes the biggest auth gap.
3. 🔴 **Public-safe views** (stop leaking `user_id`) + **private media buckets** (P2).
4. 🔴 Rename **`subscriptions` → `platform_subscriptions`** before fan subs (P3).
5. 🟠 **Test runner + CI** (P1/P2) — every later phase's acceptance depends on it.
6. 🟠 Wire the **T2 server-action tier** (P2) — required for money/entitlements/admin.
7. 🟡 **Phase-1 hardening** (theme apply, banner, plan label, dead links, atomic reorder) — cheap wins that make the OS production-credible.
